# Skedula - HowTo
## Icons
### Default icons
If no custom icons are present, all leaf skedula nodes (those without children) will be marked with the **leave icon**: ![Leaf Icon](./Design/Images/Raster/leaf_16.png), nodes with childern with the **tree icon**: ![Tree Icon](./Design/Images/Raster/tree_16.png) (both are provisore and due to be replaced with graphically better ones).
### Custom isons
Users are free to add their own icons. The icons are to be found in the ```icons``` subfolder of the executive directory. If it does not exist, feel free to create and fill it. All images that are in this subfolder, will appear in the SkedulaNode dialog and can be selected from there.
#### Management of custom icons
Just add and delete image files in the ```icons``` subfolder.
