# ![Skedula-Logo](skedula-logo_48.png) Skedula  
A lightweight, fast, uncluttered outliner for personal planning and note-keeping.

Skedula is a minimalist tree-structured organizer inspired by the elegance of
classical paper agendas and the simplicity of hierarchical lists.  
It focuses on clarity, speed, and usability — without the feature bloat common
in larger task management applications.
