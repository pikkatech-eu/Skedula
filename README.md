# Skedula  
A lightweight, fast, uncluttered outliner for personal planning and note-keeping.

Skedula is a minimalist tree-structured organizer inspired by the elegance of
classical paper agendas and the simplicity of hierarchical lists.  
It focuses on clarity, speed, and usability — without the feature bloat common
in larger task management applications.

the origin of the English “schedule”.

The name reflects the app’s purpose:
a simple place to keep your small notes, plans, and intentions.
